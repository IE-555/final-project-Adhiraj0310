## How to Run the Code

### Environment

Install the required dependencies

```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Note:** Use pip or pip3 in the above command as per your pip env variable name.

### Execution

**Running python file**

There is one python file i.e., `weather_regression.py` which requires one of the following enumeration for standard IO input as target for modeling. Use one of the following strings as input for execution.

```
temperature
humidity
precipitation
windspeed
```

Ensure the input is one of these names as it is an enuremation.

To run the file, from the project root directory

```
python3 weather_regression.py
```

**Note:** Use python or python3 in the above command as per your Python env variable name of the version you are using.

You will be prompted to provide input when the program starts running, then provide one of the target names mentioned above.

**Notebook**

If you are using Anaconda or Jupyter setup or VS Code python notebook setup, then you can execute the `weather_regresion.ipynb` notebook file by running all cells of the notebook. 

In VSCode, you will find this Run All button to execute this code. Follow the top floating prompt to input the target when asked in the code(from 10th cell) and hit 'Enter' to pass the input enumeration string.
