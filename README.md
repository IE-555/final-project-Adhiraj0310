Proposed Project Title:

Weather Forecasting using Python: Analyzing Historical Data for Future Predictions


Option 2 - Online Data Analysis


Data Sources

We are planning to use the data source from Weather API and open-meteo as they contain all the necessary information and parameters we will need for our project.
https://www.weatherapi.com/docs/
https://open-meteo.com/en/docs/historical-weather-api#latitude=42.89&longitude=-78.88&start_date=2023-03-30&end_date=2023-04-13&hourly=temperature_2m
https://archive-api.open-meteo.com/v1/archive?latitude=42.89&longitude=-78.88&start_date=2023-03-30&end_date=2023-04-13&hourly=temperature_2m

Analysis Plan

Analysis steps to be performed:

1.Data Acquisition : 
We will first gather historical weather data from a large number of relevant data sources accessible online, and then retrieve the data via an API.

2.Data cleaning : 
We will clean and preprocess the data once we have collected it to eliminate any missing or inaccurate information.  To prepare the data for use in a regression  model, we may need to normalize or scale it.

3.Variable engineering : 
Once the data has been cleaned and preprocessed, We must extract relevant features for use in our regression model. The purpose of Variable engineering is to identify the most essential variables for weather forecasting and to prepare the data for use in a regression model.

4.Model Selection : 
Once the required characteristics have been collected, we must choose an acceptable regression model to employ for weather forecasting.The model used will be determined by the unique use case and the type of the data.

5.Model Training and Evaluation : 
Using past weather data, we must train the regression model. This entails dividing the data into training and testing sets and training the model using the training set. We must assess the model's performance on the testing set once it has been trained. 

6.Data Interpretation: 
Once we've created a regression model for weather forecasting using historical data, we need to understand the findings. Understanding the patterns and trends in the data and applying the model to provide insights and forecasts is required.

The selected source data for weather forecasting requested through Python is obtained from ‘weather api’ & 'open-meteo', which is historical weather data, is a rich and relevant data source for doing the study. With such a vast dataset  Historical weather data comprises information on previous weather patterns such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation, which may be used to determine patterns and trends that might improve future weather forecasts. Python libraries and tools, such as NumPy, Pandas, etc.. can be used to analyze datasets and train a model in python to predict the future weather forecast.

Motivation

Accurate weather forecasting is essential for businesses such as agriculture, transportation, and energy, as well as people who plan outside activities or travel. We can acquire insights into weather patterns and trends by analyzing historical weather data, which may influence future weather predictions and help users make better decisions. We'll also learn about how weather patterns have evolved through time and how they could alter in the future. By analyzing this data, we will be able to apply the programming skills we learned in class to real-world problems.
